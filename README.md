## Introduce

This website is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. I've leveraged Sequelize, a Node.js ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool, to interact with the database. Users can  manage restaurants through  buttons for creation, deletion, reading, and updating. I trust you'll have delightful user experience.
